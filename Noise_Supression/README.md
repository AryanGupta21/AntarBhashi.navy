# Real-Time Audio Noise Reduction

This Python script performs real-time audio noise reduction using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a basic noise subtraction technique. It captures audio from the microphone, enhances it, and saves the output to a WAV file.

## Features

- Real-time audio input from microphone
- STFT-based denoising
- Simple spectral subtraction method
- Saves enhanced audio to disk
- Visualizes the waveform of the enhanced audio

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
